### About:
This is still very much a work in progress, but I am trying to recreate the code in "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" 100% in Python. 

### To-Do:
> Chapters in "Ray Tracing In One Weekend":
> - [x] Output an Image
> - [x] The Vector3 Class
> - [x] Rays, a Simple Camera, and Background
> - [x] Adding a Sphere
> - [x] Surface Normals and Multiple Objects
> - [x] Moving Camera Code Into Its Own Class
> - [x] Antialiasing
> - [x] Diffuse Materials
> - [x] Metal
> - [ ] Dielectrics
> - [ ] Positionable Camera
> - [ ] Defocus Blur
> - [ ] Where Next?

### Why I Stopped
I have came to the conclusion that Python is definitely not the right language to write a ray-tracer in. It is way too slow, and I have started learning C++. Will remake this in C++ to make this exponentially faster.
